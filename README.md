## This project is great for quick visual analysis of Thai stock market behavior â€” ideal for students, investors, or developers exploring financial data, It also serves as a practical exercise in learning how to explore data and turn it into meaningful visualizations.

It was originally an exercise task assigned by my senior at our company, giving me a practical challenge to apply data visualization skills **Dash and Plotly** in a real-world context.

You can easily extend this app with more indicators, trading signals, or real-time alerts.

> ðŸ“˜ This project also marks my first hands-on experience with Plotly Dash â€” a great learning journey into building interactive data apps with Python.
